### An 8 Puzzle Game

The 8-puzzle problem is a puzzle invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s. It is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square blocks labeled 1 through 8 and a blank square. Your goal is to rearrange the blocks so that they are in order. You are permitted to slide blocks horizontally or vertically into the blank square. Find a sequence of legal moves from an initial board position to the goal position.

Write a program that is intelligent enough to solve the 8-puzzle game in any configuration, in the least number of moves. 
    1. DFS
    2. BFS
    3. bidirectional BFS
    4. Branch and Bound
    5. A* search (heuristic function: difference, manhattan)
    6. IDA*

### Cantor Expansion:
    8-puzzle is expanded to a number, which is a permuation of 0-8.
    
### Summary of Search Algorithm:
    #### Binary Search O(logN)
    #### Linear Search O(N)
        1. DFS
        2. BFS
        3. DLS: depth limited search for unbounded tree
        4. IDDFS (IDS)=DFS+BFS
        5. backtracking/Branch and Bound
        6. Heuristic search: A* search, IDA*, hill climbing, Simulated Annealing, Genetic
