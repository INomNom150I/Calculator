### Number-theoretic functions
    1. Wilson's Theorem : if p is prime number, then (p-1)! %p == -1 (or p-1), and vice versa
    2. Euler's Totient Theorem (RSA): if n and a co-prime, a**e(n) %n == 1,  
    3. Chinese Remainder Theorem
    4. Fermat's Little Theorem: if p is prime number, a%p !=0, (a**p) %p == 1, otherwise ==0

    Euler's totient function: 
    Number of divisors / sum of divisors

### Linear Programming (79)

    Problem: 
        1. n variables x1,...,xn.
        2. m linear inequalities in these variables (equalities OK too), e.g., 3x1 +4x2 ≤6, 0≤x1 ≤3, etc.
        3. We may also have a linear objective function. E.g., 2x1 + 3x2 + x3.
    Goal: Find values for the xi’s that satisfy the constraints and maximize the objective.
